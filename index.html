      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/grad.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Thomas Brown">

      <p>Iâ€™m passionate and amazed by the continued growth of technology over the years. Technology is the centerpiece of our daily dynamics and I want to be a part of not only this opportunity, but its continued growth. I am young, creative, and innovative and my love of technology only pushes my creative thinking. </p>
      
      <p>I attended Furman University where I received a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology with a Business cognate. I have taken multiple computer science, IT and business courses that have allowed me to narrow down what I wish to accomplish in this field. My ultimate goal is to become a highly-experienced software developer with hopes of owning my own business one day. Since I graduated, I took what I learned at Furman and began to teach myself even more coding. I keep myself updated with the software by practicing coding everyday.  I also have a team of programmers and we all network and help each other on projects as well. </p>
      
      <p>My uncle is the head of an IT department with UPS, my best man is a programmer analyst for the Charlotte Hornets, his brother is a back-end developer in Atlanta Georgia, their dad is a software developer. We all network and help each other out. </p>
